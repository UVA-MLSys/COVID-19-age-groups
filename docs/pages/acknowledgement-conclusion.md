# Conclusions 
In this work, we showed how to interpret state-of-the-art
time series transformer models using very dynamic and
complex COVID-19 infection data. We provide a thorough
analysis of recent times series interpretation methods per-
formance on the state-of-the-art Transformer models. Our
results show that we can not only interpret changes in fea-
ture importance over past time steps but also predict the sen-
sitivity of these features in future horizons. Our proposed
framework can be very helpful in understanding the impacts
of the past info, but also to predict their impacts in the fu-
ture. Future works include capturing higher-order relations
between the input features and benchmarking more time se-
ries models with our framework.
