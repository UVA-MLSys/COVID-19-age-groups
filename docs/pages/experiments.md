# Experiments

This section describes our experimental setup for preparing
the best time series model for the COVID-19 infection fore-
casting task at the daily US county level. In the next section,
we describe how we interpret this model using black-box
interpretation methods. All of our experiments were done in
a remote HPC server with NVIDIA V100 GPU and 32 GB
memory.
