# Feature Importance
In this section, we describe our interpretation methods and
how to evaluate the interpretation performance across differ-
ent methods. The interpretation is done using the FEDformer
model on the test set. However, the approach used is generic
and model-agnostic. Hence, it can be used for any other time
series model too.
